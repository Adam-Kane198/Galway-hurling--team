        <h1>introduction to hurling</h1>

           <p>The game of Hurling has prehistoric origins and has been played in Ireland for at least
            3,000 years years in Ireland with the first literary reference dating back to 1272 BC.
            In historical texts the earliest reference to hurling appears to have been made about 1272 BC
            at the battle of Moytura, near Cong in County Mayo. since then hurling has become a traditional
            sport for ireland and has become extremely popular and competitive.</p>

        <h2> biography</h2>

            <p> The Galway county hurling team represents Galway in hurling and is governed by Galway GAA,
            the County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The team competes in the three major annual
            inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, the Leinster Senior Hurling
            Championship and the National Hurling League. It formerly competed in the abolished Connacht Senior Hurling
            Championship, winning the last title in 1999.Galway's home ground is Pearse Stadium, Salthill.
            The team's manager is Shane O'Neill.The team last won the Leinster Senior Championship in 2018,
            the All-Ireland Senior Championship in 2017 and the National League in 2017.</p>

        <h3> history </h2>

            <p>In the first ever all ireland senior hurling championship in 1887, Galway were runner up, losing 
            to tipperary to the final. They didnt get into another final till 1923, where they defeated limrick 
            to recieve their first ever whin in the all ireland championship. Since then galway struggled to get a win such as being
            runner ups in 1924, 1925, 1928, etc. It had been 35 years since their only triumph. Like many counties
            that had previously experienced success before enduring a lengthy spell without titles, Galway 
            became the subject of rumours of a curse. To this day, Galway have won the all ireland hurling final 
            17 times, most recent being in 2017. </p>
