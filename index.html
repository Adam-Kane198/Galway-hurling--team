        <h2> Introduction to hurling </h2>

           <p>The game of Hurling has prehistoric origins and has been played in Ireland for at least <br>
            3,000 years years in Ireland with the first literary reference dating back to 1272 BC. <br>
            In historical texts the earliest reference to hurling appears to have been made about 1272 BC <br>
            at the battle of Moytura, near Cong in County Mayo. since then hurling has become a traditional <br>
            sport for ireland and has become extremely popular and competitive.</p>

        <h2> Biography </h2>

            <p> The Galway county hurling team represents Galway in hurling and is governed by Galway GAA, <br>
            the County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The team competes in the three major annual <br>
            inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, the Leinster Senior Hurling <br>
            Championship and the National Hurling League. It formerly competed in the abolished Connacht Senior Hurling <br>
            Championship, winning the last title in 1999.Galway's home ground is Pearse Stadium, Salthill. <br>
            The team's manager is Shane O'Neill.The team last won the Leinster Senior Championship in 2018, <br>
            the All-Ireland Senior Championship in 2017 and the National League in 2017.</p>

        <h2> History </h2>

            <p>In the first ever all ireland senior hurling championship in 1887, Galway were runner up, losing <br>
            to tipperary to the final. They didnt get into another final till 1923, where they defeated limrick <br>
            to recieve their first ever whin in the all ireland championship. Since then galway struggled to get a win such as being <br>
            runner ups in 1924, 1925, 1928, etc. It had been 35 years since their only triumph. Like many counties <br>
            that had previously experienced success before enduring a lengthy spell without titles, Galway  <br>
            became the subject of rumours of a curse. To this day, Galway have won the all ireland hurling final  <br>
            17 times, most recent being in 2017. </p>
